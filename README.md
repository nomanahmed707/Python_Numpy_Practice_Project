# NumPy Library Practice Notebook: Essential NumPy Toolkit

Welcome to **NumPy Library Practice Notebook**, a hands-on Jupyter Notebook designed for mastering **NumPy**, Python’s fundamental library for numerical computing. Whether you're dealing with mathematical operations, scientific computing, or preparing data for machine learning, this notebook provides a practical and clear guide to efficiently work with arrays.

## 📘 What You'll Learn

🔍 **Array Creation & Inspection**
* Creating arrays from lists.
* Understanding array dimensions and shapes (`.shape`, `.ndim`, `.size`).
* Checking data types (`.dtype`) and specifying them during creation.
* Generating arrays with `np.fromiter()`, `np.arange()`, and `np.linspace()`.
* Creating placeholder arrays: `np.empty()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`.

🛠 **Array Manipulation & Transformation**
* Reshaping arrays with `.reshape()`.
* Concatenating arrays using `np.concatenate()`.
* Flattening multi-dimensional arrays with `.flatten()`.
* Reversing arrays using `np.flip()`.

📊 **Data Operations & Analysis**
* Sorting arrays with `np.sort()` and `np.argsort()`.
* Finding minimum, maximum, and sum of array elements (`.min()`, `.max()`, `.sum()`).
* Extracting unique elements with `np.unique()`.
* Basic array indexing and slicing.

💾 **Array Input/Output**
* Saving and loading NumPy arrays using `.npy` files (`np.save()`, `np.load()`).
* Saving and loading arrays to/from CSV files (`np.savetxt()`, `np.loadtxt()`).
